# CAM-SUST_Summer_School_on_Astrophysics_2025

The CAM-SUST Summer School on Astrophysics 2025 is a two-week-long program for undergraduate students and early-career researchers from Bangladesh, organized by the Copernicus Astronomical Memorial of SUST (CAM-SUST). The program is a hybrid summer school scheduled for September 3–14, 2025, designed for motivated undergraduate students in Physics, Astronomy, Engineering, and related fields from across Bangladesh.
Format:
The first week (September 3–7) will primarily consist of online lecture sessions. The second week (September 11–14) will feature in-person, lecture-based hands-on training sessions conducted by guest astronomers and researchers.
The weekday schedule includes lecture sessions covering astrophysical topics and techniques, including phenomena and processes such as:

Star formation processes
Galaxy distribution in the Universe
Cosmic Web and largest structures in the Universe
Galaxy clusters and galaxy evolution
Stellar mass functions and density profiles
Black Hole Collisions
Space-time curvature near black holes
Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) and their use in cosmology
The hands-on sessions will focus on data access, reduction, analysis and simulation tools, and modeling techniques used by current researchers and astronomers.

Participants:
The workshop is intended for undergraduate students (1st to 4th year), and early-career researchers in Bangladesh who are motivated to pursue a research career in astronomy. Applicants from science, engineering, or related fields are welcome. Basic familiarity with programming (preferably Python) is expected.
Selection will be based on programming experience, motivation, and how participants may benefit from the summer school. Participants must bring their own laptops with a working internet browser and be ready for coding-based hands-on sessions.
Program Starts: 3 September 2025
Program Ends: 14 September 2025
Location:
1st week lecture sessions: Virtual/Remote
2nd week Hands-on sessions: SUST-Campus, Sylhet (Offline/In person)
