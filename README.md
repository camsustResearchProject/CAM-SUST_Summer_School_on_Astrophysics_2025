The CAM-SUST Summer School on Astrophysics 2025 is a two-week-long program for undergraduate students and early-career researchers from Bangladesh, organized by the Copernicus Astronomical Memorial of SUST (CAM-SUST). The program is a hybrid summer school scheduled for September 3–14, 2025, designed for motivated undergraduate students in Physics, Astronomy, Engineering, and related fields from across Bangladesh.

`Format`:
The first week (September 3–7) will primarily consist of online lecture sessions. The second week (September 11–14) will feature in-person, lecture-based hands-on training sessions conducted by guest astronomers and researchers.
The weekday schedule includes lecture sessions covering astrophysical topics and techniques, including phenomena and processes such as:

<ol>
 <li>Star formation processes </li>
 <li>Galaxy distribution in the Universe </li>
 <li>Cosmic Web and largest structures in the Universe </li>
 <li>Galaxy clusters and galaxy evolution </li>
 <li>Stellar mass functions and density profiles </li> 
 <li>Black Hole Collisions </li>
 <li>Space-time curvature near black holes </li> 
 <li>Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) and their use in cosmology </li>
</ol>

The hands-on sessions will focus on data access, reduction, analysis and simulation tools, and modeling techniques used by current researchers and astronomers.

`Participants`:
The program is intended for undergraduate students (1st to 4th year), and early-career researchers in Bangladesh who are motivated to pursue a research career in astronomy. Applicants from science, engineering, or related fields are welcome. Basic familiarity with programming (preferably Python) is expected. <br>

Selection will be based on programming experience, motivation, and how participants may benefit from the summer school. Participants must bring their own laptops with a working internet browser and be ready for coding-based hands-on sessions. <br>

`Program Starts`: 3 September 2025 <br>
`Program Ends`: 12 September 2025 <br>
`Location`:
1st week lecture sessions: Virtual/Remote
2nd week Hands-on sessions: SUST-Campus, Sylhet (Offline/In person)
